#### The Power of the Rosary

<em>The Rosary is the book of the blind, where souls see and there enact the greatest drama of love the world has ever known; it is the book of the simple, which initiates them into mysteries and knowledge more satisfying than the education of other men; it is the book of the aged, whose eyes close upon the shadow of this world, and open on the substance of the next. The power of the Rosary is beyond description.</em>

**The theological truths and teachings of the Church are beautiful but can sometimes be inaccessible for children and adults alike. The power of the Rosary allows all the faithful to engage in Crist’s deep and abiding love. It is particularly powerful when shared with children**

There is simply no greater spiritual boon than to engage children in our faith and tradition. As a teacher and catechist, I am consistently moved by the simultaneous simplicity and depth of their faith. I have especially loved teaching middle school students the beauty of the Rosary. As part of the lesson, each one makes his or her own knotted Rosary, and then we learn to pray it together. The enthusiasm and earnest desire each student conveys never fail to blow me away.

As an adult, I have a lot to learn from these children. When conflict arises, I often seek consolation in the teachings of the Church and forget the incredible gift of praying the Rosary - a time to “listen” to the lives of Jesus and Mary and allow them to speak to my life. It is often my heart that has to change. not my mind. In the Rosary, my heart that has to change, not my mind. In the Rosary, my heart encounters Jesus through Mary

Christ’s Incarnation, Death, and Resurrection are truly what Archbishop Fulton Sheen called the “greatest drama of love the world has ever known.” The gift of Rosary is that it allows us to access our story of salvation and journey with Christ. Like so many things in the life of faith, my students<br> and their natural enthusiasm for engaging in this kind of prayer have taught me that “the power of the Rosary is beyond description.”
